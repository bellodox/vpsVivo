Not only am I paying for this but I have a responsability to the people. If we want to go to bittrex, I have to be squeeky clean. That is why I would rather stay anonymous until everything falls into place properly.








Announcement

As of Today, I am now fully in charge of VIVO. Jimmy has transfered VIVO operations.

Currently we see a price decrease that had made some think that the coin was abandoned This delayed annoncement did not help. 

Moving forward, several issues need to be dealt with:

1.Block times
2.High speed delivery of new projects
	web wallet
	multi sig functionality
3.Marketing Plan
4.Whitepaper

In order to improve the coin, an upgraded network of nodes is what is needed. To do that, developers upgrade the software and after hodlers upgrade their wallets and the network is upgraded.
Currently there is no way to have hodlers update their wallets or masternodes and many have not.

For instance, currently there are 900 masternodes that require a new start. That means the people are not paying attantion to wallets and upgrades. Based on that, forking the code was not an option because many would not upgrade and the new code would be conflicting with old code for a long time.

Originally. a coin upgrade through forking was planned but after multiple problems emerged, it could not be implemented. Now, private funds (mine) are being loaned to be able to upgrade the coin through an exchange of coins/swap. The forking was not only very expensive, but also time consuming with multiple split chains and it would have been far more frustrating to the community causing dramatic proce drops. By going through this methode of upgrade VIVO will improve exponentially.

The upgraded coin will be called Vivacious Coin but will still have the ticker VIVO

Specs on the upgraded coin.

Auto update capability for self hosted masternodes
Wallets that can control masternode creation

Proof of Stake 
	no more energy consuming hardware mining necessay. 
	Uniform Block times	
	You will not need to have a masternode to earn rewards, you can stake
ipv6 capable
	vps hosting should go down as those ips are usually free
Inter market trading
	blocknet
	fiat exchange system for vivo (bisq)

Things we may or may not lose are (unless there is funding):
cripto bridge
coinomi	

The website and discord will be where Github and market cap say it is.



Will vivacious use the same port as the old vivo?

Stop Exchanging on Cryptopia

Vivacious Go Live Day

Because I am spending my own money, I am leery about certain risks.
If there is a 51 percent attack while we are waiting for exchange day.

I want to be able to back out before the day, for instance if there is a 51 percent attack.



There is talk of the coin being half the number of present coins.
So everyone would have 1 vivo for the ones the presently have. That concerns me because, the current price will not be adjusted.
But the idea of increase number of coins needed for a masternode makes sense to me.

But the best distribution is not clear to me.




I will assume a worst case that the new pivx based on goes down to 1 cent a piece.
We need to have an agreement that you will not sell all your new vivo, imediately.

If people made a loan to vivo, the worst case it has to be set it up where the coin would pay back the lenders.

Several ways of dealing with this, if I have to do this with my money, the vivo has to pay me back somehow.





I was thinking, the least amount of work, the least amount of reinventing the wheel, why not just grab, pivx or bulwark and rename, change prefix, genesis etc.
Won't we have all their capabilities including electrum built in?

Basically I would like to get your help without using my personal funds and taking all the risk for the community. But the community has been battered hard.

We will be changing the coin name to vivacious, but we keep the ticker vivo.
	
1. To be ipv6 capable right away, so that vps costs are affordable to people.
2. Bisque code has to be set up.
3. Electrum server and wallet
4. Insight and its web wallet.
5. Functioning gitian build system release system
6. Zerocoin implementation already in

Masternodes will require double, and the reward is double.
I am leary about giving 1 coin for every 2 vivo because the market does not care. Suddenly they have far less vivo.
Masternode require more I would agree.

Most new dev will be in webwallet using bisq for ease of use.
   proprietary bisq web wallet.
   

A dev fund will be available.
Unlike PIVX, it will not be never ending, there must be a cap. 21 million i assume.
A percentage will go to dev.

There are issues to deal with. One is to be sure that cryptopia will not cause other problems, other requiements and payments or delisting.


One choice would have been crowdfunding, but right now, I don't think anyone will fund anything.
I will be doing this as a loan to VIVO and hope to be paid back.

So, I need more education on how does the mining happen, who handles the coins, the accounting. etc.
What is the schedule of payments to people.
Whe gets what when, and security issues.

The possibility is that it will fail right a way.
To mitigate the possiblity it has to hit the ground running.
I will help with dev, so that should lighten some of the load.
For it to prevent a freefall, I believe we have to have these MINIMUM capabilities

-From a PR standpoint, this is a coin upgrade, not a coin swap.

1. To be ipv6 capable right away, so that vps costs are affordable to people.
2. Bisque code has to be set up.
3. Electrum server and wallet
4. Insight and its web wallet.
5. Functioning gitian build system and release system

-I don't not want the first git commit to be a renaming excercise in PIVX
-web wallet and multisig are requirements
-Crypto bridge, will be delisted, we can't affort them.

As of a day or two ago, I have been given operational control of VIVO. Up until now, I could not do what had to be done because of lack of access and lack of control.
Now it is different.

I am a c++ java developer that went into management so building software is my bread and butter. Clearly there are some differences in doing work in business vs. the altcoin space.
The previos leaders were mostly in the financial sphere.

The first issue to deal with is the excessive cost of masternodes.
hoddling in masternodes is too expensive right now.

The docker solution will be replaced with a in wallet masternode control system, your wallet will build your masternode through ssh. (unless you host it with someone)

To allow masternode hosting to be worthwhile and these prices, masternode collateral amounts will be increased. The reward will be the same, but you will not have to get extra ips.

The overall value that will next be focused on is "ease of use".

A web wallet is being working on right now.

Ease of use elements include:

Being able to know what version you have and if you are behind
Being able to build a masternode quickly and with minim effort
Building a msternode with the least amount of effort.
If you are on the wrong chain, getting back on with minimum effort and time.
Web wallet availability
Explorers being available most of the time and correct












 

















We need web wallet instead of android and ios.
PI Wallet
masternode builder with autoupdater
wallet to have a new version signal.

- Android
- IOS wallet
- Tor or Ip2 functionality

I have to talk to coinomi to see what costs they have.

-Coinomy
-vivocoin.net
-blocknet
















How will funds be dispersed.
Then I will have to handle people that come in far later and complain. A fund to handle those.

How to pay it anonymously.





















 


#Syncing databases with the blockchain
#sync.js (located in scripts/) is used for updating the local databases. This script must be called from the explorers root directory.

#Usage: node scripts/sync.js [database] [mode]

#database: (required)
#index [mode] Main index: coin info/stats, transactions & addresses
#market       Market data: summaries, orderbooks, trade history & chartdata

#mode: (required for index database only)
#update       Updates index from last sync to current block
#check        checks index for (and adds) any missing transactions/addresses
#reindex      Clears index then resyncs from genesis to current block

#notes:
# 'current block' is the latest created block when script is executed.
# The market database only supports (& defaults to) reindex mode.
# If check mode finds missing data(ignoring new data since last sync),
#  index_timeout in settings.json is set too low.
